\section{Motivation}

Internet denizens have long found ways to communicate ideas and have vibrant communications about a wide variety content.
However, these discussions typically are not supported directly alongside the content.
The usual avenues of discourse today are through Facebook, Reddit, bulletin board style forums, and other such mediums.

Our goal is to introduce a way to bring this discussion directly to where the content is at: a web page.
Being able to open a web page and immediately jump into a discussion through our extension will allow users to find and contribute relevant information quickly.
The idea that information should be freely accessible runs deep within the ideology of the internet.
Often, this leads into a rabbit-hole effect of finding more about the topic at hand.
Comment Anywhere strives to bring the discussion directly to the content.
