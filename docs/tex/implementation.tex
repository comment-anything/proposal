\section{Implementation Techniques}

\subsection{Browser Extensions}

The Extensions will be designed according to the extension specifications of supported browsers. They will use HTML and Javascript and other components as necessary to implement the extension. 

The WebExtension Polyfill library may help eliminate duplicate code between each platform.


\subsection{Backend Services}

A number of Implementation options exist for the backend services:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Golang 
    \item C\#, ASP.NET
    \item Java, Spring
    \item Python, Django/Flask
    \item Javascript/Typescript, Node.JS
\end{itemize}

A relational database is likely to fit best, such as PostgreSQL.

Analysis of the benefits of each technology stack is ongoing.


\subsection{Project Homepage}

A homepage detailing information about the project will utilize a simple stack to present a static web page.
