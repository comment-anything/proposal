\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Browser Extensions}

The basis of Comment Anywhere are the browser extensions. 
We aim to support popular internet browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

\subsection{Human Moderation}

Comments will be subject to human moderation through several means.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Ratings - Similar to Likes or Upvotes, users should be able to rate the relevancy of a comment. Higher rated comments rise to the top.
    \item User Reports - Comments that are off topic, violate community guidelines or standards, or contain offensive material can be reported for manual moderation.
    \item Moderator Review - Designated volunteer moderators will evaluate comments that are flagged by users and by the automoderation system and determine appropriate actions to take based on commenting rules.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Automated Moderation}

Some comments should be subject to moderation guidelines at the time of submission.
Sentiment Analysis, keyword searches, and machine learning can all be applied to analyze comments upon submission to find rule breaking behavior and take direct action or flag the comment for human review.

\subsection{Backend Services}

Comment Anywhere will rely on a number of backend services including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comment Database and API
    \item Comment Analysis and Moderation
    \item Comment Delivery
    \item User Authentication
    \item Security, Password encryption
    \item Metrics
    \item User Information
    \item Moderation and Administration Services
\end{itemize}
