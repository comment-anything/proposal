\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Browser Extensions}

The basis of Comment Anywhere are the browser extensions. 
We aim to support popular internet browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

\subsection*{Crowd Sourced Moderation}

We aim to bring two methods of user moderation to the platform:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Ratings - Similar to Likes or Upvotes, users should be able to rate the relevancy of a comment. Higher rated comments rise to the top.
    \item User Reports - Comments that are off topic, violate community guidelines or standards, or contain offensive material can be reported for manual moderation.
\end{enumerate}

Comment Anywhere Users with good standing and history will be asked to participate in Moderation, as a Community Volunteer.
These select users will be able to access a Moderation section where they can review reported comments for rulebreaking behavior.

\subsection*{Automated Moderation}

Some comments should be subject to moderation guidelines at the time of submission.
Sentiment Analysis, keyword searches, and machine learning can all be applied to analyze comments upon submission to find rule breaking behavior.

\subsection*{Backend Services}

Comment Anywhere will rely on a number of backend services including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comment Database and API
    \item Comment Analysis and Moderation
    \item User Information
    \item Moderation and Administration Services
\end{itemize}
