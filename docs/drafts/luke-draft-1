## Motivation
The World Wide Web was created for users to easily communicate and access information. Everyone has the opportunity to connect, which is especially true regarding social media services. Unfortunately, these services restrict all discussions to the confines of their own platform. When an internet user wants to share their thoughts of a website they're viewing, why should they leave the page to make a comment?

Comment Anywhere allows users to post direct comments about the current website in view. Not only is this convenient, but in some situations, it is necessary for having conversations regarding censored webpages with disabled comments.

## Objectives
**Browser Extension**
Comment Anywhere can be easily accessed straight from the web browser via our browser extension. This service is compatible with Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

**User Accounts**
Users may choose to create a *Comment Anywhere* account, or login with outside services such as Google or Facebook. Internal accounts must store and update passwords securely. Users have the ability to rate, report, and reply to comments. Users will be given a score to represent a good standing within the community.

**Backend Services**
- Database of URLs with their associated comments
- Database of reported comments
- Database of unsupported websites to fix
- Database of Comment Anywhere accounts
- User account authentication and control
- Moderator account privileges
- Automated moderation system
- Comment retrieval and cache

**Homepage**
The homepage will host information regarding our project.

## Implementation Techniques
**Possible Backend Languages**

**Algorithms**
