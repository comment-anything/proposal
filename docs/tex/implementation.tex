\section{Implementation Techniques}

\subsection{Browser Extensions}

JavaScript is the de facto language of the web today.
Extensions for browsers utilize the same technology stack.

Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other popular browsers each publish their own tools for developing and testing extensions.
The WebExtension Polyfill library should help eliminate duplicate code between each platform.


\subsection{Backend Services}

A number of Implementation options exist for the backend services:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Golang 
    \item C\#, ASP.NET
    \item Java, Spring
    \item Python, Django/Flask
    \item Javascript/Typescript, Node.JS
\end{itemize}

A relational database is likely to fit best, such as PostgreSQL.

Analysis of the pros and cons of each technology stack is ongoing.


\subsection{Project Homepage}

A homepage detailing information about the project will utilize a simple stack to present a static web page.
